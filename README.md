Introduction
----------------------------

### Bitcoin Implementation in C#

**What is Blockcore?**

- Blockcore is a platform to build Layer 1 consensus networks based on the Bitcoin protocol, built on the [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) framework and written entirely in C#. 
- Blockcore aims to maintain an alternative C# Bitcoin implementation, based on the [NBitcoin](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin) & [Stratis](https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode) projects.
- Blockcore is neither a coin or a for profit business.

**Why Blockcore?**

- We see a need within the crypto ecosystem for development of the C# full node technology.
- [Stratis](https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode) has provided an excellent starting point but their focus is enterprise and business. We feel strongly that there is significant value focusing on open & public blockchains, using open source software.

**Blockcore objectives**

- Continue development of the C# Stratis fullnode.
- Maintain the C# Bitcoin fullnode.
- Support projects and teams that use the underlying technology.
- Extend the technology by building developer and user tools
- Provide a forum for developers and teams to collaborate and improve on the technology.
- Build relationships with potential sponsors & partners to help boost the pace of development.

**Blockcore principles**

- We help each other, and all projects that utilise the underlying technology.
- We encourage contribution to the Blockcore open source software.
- We aim to make it easier for everyone to contribute to the ecosystem.
- We encourage projects to adopt Blockcore technology as we believe every project has something to offer and help make the technology stronger.
