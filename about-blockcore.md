**What is Blockcore?**

- Blockcore is a [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) platform to build decentralized networks based on the Bitcoin protocol
- Blockcore is a platform to build Layer 1 consensus networks based on the Bitcoin protocol, built on the [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) framework and written entirely in C#. 
- Blockcore aims to maintain an alternative C# Bitcoin implementation, based on the [NBitcoin](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin) & [Stratis](https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode) projects.
- Blockcore isn't a coin.
- Blockcore isn't a for profit business.

**Why Blockcore?**

- We see a need within the crypto ecosystem for development of the C# full node technology.
- Stratis has provided an excellent starting point but their focus is enterprise and businesses and we feel strongly that there is also value focusing on open and public blockchains.

**Blockcore objectives**

- Continue development of the C# Stratis fullnode.
- Maintain the C# Bitcoin fullnode.
- Support projects and teams that use the underlying technology.
- Extend the technology by building developer and user tools
- Provide a forum for developers and teams to collaborate and improve on the technology.

**Blockcore principles**

- We support public open blockchains, not working with enterprises or consulting with businesses  
- We encourage contribution to the blockcore open source software.
- We aim to make it easier for everyone to contribute to the ecosystem.
- We help each other, and all projects that utilise the underlying technology.
- We encourage projects to adopt Blockcore technology as we believe every project has something to offer and help make the technology stronger.
